"""Web backend: the catalogue, feedback writes and a chat proxy.

The dashboard asks this server for the catalogue - search, filters, sort and
paging are in catalogue.py - so the page, the API and the MCP tools at /mcp
answer from one implementation. Two writes are worth a note:

  POST /api/feedback   a thumbs up or down cannot be written from a static
                       page, and it has to reach the same SQLite the
                       classifier reads calibration examples from.

  POST /api/chat       NCSA Lumen sends no CORS headers, verified against the
                       live gateway, so a browser cannot call it directly. This
                       forwards the request and nothing more.

The viewer's API key is never stored, never logged, and never written to disk.
It arrives per request, is forwarded, and is dropped.

Chat is not recorded. There is no chat table, no INSERT on the chat path, and
the transcript exists only in the browser tab that made it. What the process
does hold, and it would be dishonest to call this nothing:

  - uvicorn's access log lines, which record client address, method and path.
    Never a request body, so never a message or a key. Silence them with
    GRANT_SIFT_ACCESS_LOG=off.
  - the rate limiter's in-memory counters, keyed by a salted hash of the
    signed-in username (the client address when auth is off) rather than the
    name itself, and lost on restart.

Rules:
- Copy the ID character for character. An ID you alter cannot be looked up.
- Judge on what the work IS, not on shared vocabulary. A call about "data
  management for clinical trials" is a poor match for an idea about managing
  climate model output, however many words they share.
- Include a call whose subject differs but whose technical requirement is the
  same: that is the most valuable kind of match, because nobody finds it by
  searching.
- Return fewer than {n} rather than padding. An empty array is a valid answer.
- Some lines carry a note about fit to our group instead of a description,
  because no description was generated for that call yet. Treat those as
  weaker evidence, not as a reason to skip the call."""

# Re-scoring is not searching, and reusing the search prompt was wrong: it says
