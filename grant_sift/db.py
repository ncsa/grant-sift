    in the database and on the dashboard marked "passed"; the record of what was
    once open is the point. Call this by hand, or set GRANT_SIFT_PRUNE_DAYS, if
    the table ever actually grows uncomfortable.

    Two deliberate exclusions:

    Anything with feedback is kept regardless of age. few_shot_corrections
    INNER JOINs opportunities, so deleting a row that carries a thumbs up or
    down would silently drop that hard case from every future prompt. The
    calibration corpus is the one thing here that cannot be re-fetched.

    Rolling calls (deadline IS NULL) are never pruned. The tempting rule is to
    drop them once last_seen goes stale, but a broken source stops updating
    last_seen for everything it carries, so that rule would quietly delete a
    source's whole catalogue on the day it breaks.
